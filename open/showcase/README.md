# Crovia · Showcase (Non-Canonical)

This folder contains **non-canonical** demonstration tools.

- These tools are **not** part of the public evidence ledger.
- Output artifacts (scores, badges, rankings) are **not** authoritative and must not be interpreted as registry observations.

If you are looking for canonical public data, refer to:
- `open/signal/` (presence signals)
- `open/forensic/` (absence receipts)
- `canon/necessities.v1.yaml` (NEC identifiers and definitions)
