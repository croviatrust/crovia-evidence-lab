# Crovia · PRO Shadow Pointer

This file does not publish private PRO data.

It publishes a single, verifiable fact:

> A private semantic measurement exists and is anchored by hash.

## What you can verify
- The PRO engine commit hash (public Git commit id)
- The sha256 hash of a derived delta (not published here)
- That the Open Plane recorded the anchor at a specific time

## What this does NOT claim
- No intent
- No wrongdoing
- No violation

Only: existence of an anchored measurement.
