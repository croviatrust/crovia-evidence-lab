# Proofs — Mechanical Evidence of State and Change

The Proofs layer provides **mechanical guarantees**
about integrity and temporal change of evidence artifacts.

Proofs do not interpret meaning.
Proofs do not assign responsibility.

They only demonstrate:
- that something existed
- that it changed
- when it changed

---

## What a proof is (here)

A proof is a **reproducible technical procedure**
that produces the same result when repeated
over the same inputs.

If a proof cannot be independently reproduced,
it is not a proof.

---

## Hashchain proofs

Hashchains are used to guarantee **integrity over sequences**.

They prove that:
- no element was removed
- no element was reordered
- no element was altered

A hashchain does NOT prove authorship.
A hashchain does NOT prove intent.

It proves **sequence integrity only**.

---

## Drift proofs

Drift proofs describe **change over time**.

They answer questions like:
- did an artifact change?
- when did it change?
- how frequently did it change?

They do NOT answer:
- why it changed
- who changed it
- whether the change was legitimate

Drift is a measurable condition, not an accusation.

---

## Temporal neutrality

Proofs are **time-indexed**, not judgment-based.

Time allows:
- longitudinal analysis
- historical reconstruction

Time does NOT imply motive.

---

## Relationship to Spider

Spider observes **presence / absence**.

Proofs show:
- continuity
- mutation
- stability

Spider says *what was there*.
Proofs say *what stayed the same or changed*.

---

## Relationship to CRC-1

CRC-1 seals proofs into an immutable artifact set.

CRC-1 guarantees:
- integrity of proofs
- offline verification

Proofs supply the mechanics.
CRC-1 supplies the contract.

---

## What Proofs deliberately avoid

Proofs do NOT:
- score behavior
- label compliance
- imply wrongdoing
- reference regulations

Interpretation belongs to external systems.

---

## Legal posture

Proofs are:
- deterministic
- inspectable
- reproducible

They provide **facts**, not conclusions.

---

## License

Proof artifacts inherit the repository license unless stated otherwise.
