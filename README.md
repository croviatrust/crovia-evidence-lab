# Crovia Evidence Lab

Crovia Evidence Lab is the **public, reproducible evidence layer** of Crovia.

This repository exists to demonstrate — with verifiable artifacts —
**what can be proven** about AI training transparency, without
introducing pricing, contracts, or private calibration logic.

## What lives here

- **DSSE (Open Evidence)**  
  Demonstrations of semantic drift measurement on public datasets
  (LAION, C4, DSSE-1M), with reproducible snapshots and hash anchors.

- **Spider (Presence / Absence Observation)**  
  Public observation tools and receipts recording whether auditable
  training evidence is present or absent in public repositories.

- **Proof Artifacts**  
  NDJSON snapshots, drift records, and hash-anchored files that can be
  verified offline by third parties.

## What does NOT live here

- Pricing or settlement logic
- Contract registries
- Enterprise calibration engines
- Proprietary attribution models

This repository demonstrates **evidence**.
The Crovia PRO Engine defines **settlement and governance**.
